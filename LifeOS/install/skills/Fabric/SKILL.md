# Fabric

**Contents:** Ideal State · Intent Routing · Data & Config · Gotchas · Examples

Runs any of 240+ specialized prompt patterns across extraction, summarization, analysis, creation, improvement, security, and rating. Common ones: extract_wisdom, create_threat_model, analyze_claims, improve_writing, review_code, mermaid, youtube_summary. Patterns run natively: the model reads the pattern's system.md and applies it directly, with no CLI round-trip. The fabric CLI is used only for YouTube transcripts (-y) and URL fallback (-u). A summarize-family run on a URL or on text of 200 characters or more also fires the installed harvest skill on the same input, which writes a KNOWLEDGE note (`Intents/ExecutePattern.md` § Tool contract).

The skill also holds our own modernized versions of the patterns that rank highest on value, public use and our own use (`References/PortRanking.tsv`), written as ideal-state intents with their own Assay suite and code checker. A port routes only after it beats its upstream prompt head to head on held-out inputs (`Tools/PortDuel.ts`): 51 intents covering 57 patterns, WordSummary included, run instead of the upstream prompt. Seven more are still behind upstream and listed separately; their patterns run upstream until a revision wins.

## Ideal State

- The pattern that runs is the one the request named, or the one its wording maps to, and its output keeps the format the pattern's OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS define.
- A request for a pattern we have ported runs its intent, never the upstream prompt: `create_5_sentence_summary` and `ws` run WordSummary, and every pattern in `Intents/ExecutePattern.md` § Ported patterns runs the intent it names.
- Patterns run natively from `Patterns/`; the fabric CLI is touched only for YouTube transcripts and blocked URLs.
- The local `Patterns/` library carries every pattern in upstream fabric's `data/patterns/`, takes nothing from the local fabric config, keeps the release scrub, and every update reports its before and after counts.

## Intent Routing

| Intent | Trigger | File |
|--------|---------|------|
| **ExecutePattern** | "use fabric", "run pattern", "apply pattern", "fabric extract wisdom" or the `extract_wisdom` pattern by name, "summarize", "analyze with fabric" | `Intents/ExecutePattern.md` |

### Ports still behind upstream

These intents did not beat their upstream prompt on held-out cases (record: wins-losses-ties), so the upstream pattern still runs for them through ExecutePattern. Each stays here until a revision wins its duel.

| Intent | Patterns | Duel | File |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| **SecurePrompt** | `greybeard_secure_prompt_engineer` | 1-1-1 | `Intents/SecurePrompt.md` |
| **SilentVictims** | `detect_silent_victims` | 1-0-2 | `Intents/SilentVictims.md` |
| **ExtractReferences** | `extract_references` | 1-1-1 | `Intents/ExtractReferences.md` |
| **CodingProject** | `create_coding_project` | 1-1-1 | `Intents/CodingProject.md` |
| **GitDiffSummary** | `summarize_git_diff` | 0-2-1 | `Intents/GitDiffSummary.md` |
| **CreateCommand** | `create_command` | 1-0-2 | `Intents/CreateCommand.md` |
| **ExtractInstructions** | `extract_instructions` | 1-0-2 | `Intents/ExtractInstructions.md` |

A bare "extract wisdom" with no mention of Fabric or the pattern goes to the ExtractWisdom skill, which does content-adaptive extraction.

| File | Read when |
|------|-----------|
| `Patterns/` | running a pattern: one `<name>/system.md` per pattern: upstream data synced by UpdatePatterns, plus the release-scrub edits and a few older patterns upstream has since dropped (Gotchas); `pattern_explanations.md` lists them all |
| `Tools/CheckPatterns.ts` | checking the library: key patterns present, upstream coverage (`--upstream`), and new release-scan findings after a sync (`--scan-before`/`--scan-after`) |
| `Tools/<Intent>Check.ts` | checking a port's output before delivery; each intent's Tool contract gives the exact command, and each has a `.help.md` and a `.test.ts` beside it |
| `Tools/PortDuel.ts` | judging a port against its upstream pattern on its held-out cases (`--help`) |
| `Evals/HeldOut/` | the held-out cases each port is duelled on, written before the port; builders never read them |
| `References/PortRanking.tsv` | why a pattern was or was not ported: every upstream pattern's grade, adoption, our usage and score |
| `ISA.md` | the ports project: what done means, the decisions behind the selection, and what is still open (retiring the fabric program, the monthly proposals workflow) |
| `extraction.md` | the absence review that added criteria to the ISA |
| `EvalState.md` | checking the `fabric-analyzeclaims` eval score (machine-written by Assay, never hand-edited) |
| `Setup.md` | first-time setup: the optional fabric program and yt-dlp for YouTube transcripts |

## Data & Config

User customizations live at `<configRoot>/LIFEOS/USER/CUSTOMIZATIONS/SKILLS/Fabric/` (`configRoot` is `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set, else `~/.claude`). When that directory exists, its PREFERENCES.md, configurations and resources override the defaults here; when it is absent, the defaults stand. Its `Patterns/<name>/system.md` holds the install's own local-only patterns, which never ship in the skill tree; ExecutePattern reads one only when `Patterns/` here has no pattern of that name (`Intents/ExecutePattern.md` § Tool contract).

First-time setup: [Setup.md](Setup.md).

## Gotchas

- **`fabric -y URL` for YouTube extraction — don't scrape YouTube pages.** fabric handles transcript extraction natively.
- **Pattern names are exact.** `extract_wisdom` not `extractwisdom`. Check `ls Patterns/` (or `Patterns/pattern_explanations.md`) if unsure, since patterns run from that directory, not from the CLI.
- **Patterns/ is not a byte mirror of upstream, and syncing from `~/.config/fabric/patterns/` leaks local patterns.** Some pattern files carry local edits that clear release content findings (author-name headings in the threat-model essays, author URLs), and a plain upstream copy reverts the upstream-present ones. The fabric config directory also holds local-only patterns that are not upstream, and Patterns/ keeps older patterns upstream has since dropped, the key pattern `create_threat_model` among them, so an `rsync --delete` from upstream would remove it. UpdatePatterns therefore syncs from upstream `data/patterns/` only and fails on any new release-scan finding.
- **The pattern-category catalog at the end of `Intents/ExecutePattern.md` is load-bearing, not duplication.** A release test requires more than 20 named, shipped patterns there, so a simplification pass that trims it fails the release.
- **Long content may exceed pattern context limits.** For very long inputs, chunk the content or use a summarize pattern first.

## Examples

**Example 1: Extract wisdom from content**
```
User: "Use fabric to extract wisdom from this article"
-> ExecutePattern intent, extract_wisdom pattern
-> The article's IDEAS, INSIGHTS, QUOTES and the other sections extract_wisdom defines, in its format
```

**Example 2: Update patterns**
```
User: "Update fabric patterns"
-> UpdatePatterns intent
-> Patterns/ matches upstream; the report gives the before and after pattern counts and marks each key pattern present or MISSING
```

**Example 3: Create threat model**
```
User: "Use fabric to create a threat model for this API"
-> ExecutePattern intent, create_threat_model pattern
-> A structured threat analysis of the API in the format the pattern defines
```
