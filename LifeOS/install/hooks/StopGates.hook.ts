/**
 * @version 1.3.1
 * StopGates.hook.ts — the ONE Stop-event gate hook.
 *
 * Consolidation (2026-07-11, hooks BLE pass): merges the three per-turn gate
 * spawns into one process, reading stdin ONCE. Each gate file remains the
 * owner of its logic (and stays runnable standalone via its own shim); this
 * hook imports their exported run() and evaluates in the old registration
 * order:
 *
 *   0. IsaCodeSyncGate.run() (2026-10-24, blocks; not advisory)
 *   1. VerificationGate.run()
 *   2. FormatGate.run()
 *   3. ISAFoldGate.run()
 *   4. ISAGate.run()
 *   5. DeployRegistrationGate.run()
 *   6. IsaDeployMarkerGate.run()
 *
 * Decision semantics: the FIRST gate returning a `decision:"block"` wins and
 * is emitted; later gates are still evaluated for their telemetry EXCEPT after
 * a block (matching the old behavior closely enough — two simultaneous blocks
 * were never actionable, the harness takes one recovery turn anyway).
 * `{continue:true}` returns (stop_hook_active recovery) are emitted once.
 *
 * Failure mode (1.3.0, ISA 20261015-security-p1-batch1 C8): every Stop gate is an
 * ADVISE gate. Each gate, the private-gate registry load, the unreadable-input path
 * (hook-io gateInputFailureDecision) and the dispatcher itself run under
 * runGate("advise"): a failure lets the turn end, records one Vigil `hook-error`
 * event naming the gate, and prints one stderr line.
 * One gate's crash never silences the others, and the hook always exits 0. A gate
 * module that fails at static import is outside this wrapper: the process exits
 * non-zero and the harness shows that hook error itself.
